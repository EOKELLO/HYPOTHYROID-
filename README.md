# HYPOTHYROID-

In this project we shall build a model that determines whether or not the patient's symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothyroid

our key assignments are:

- Try and optimize each of the 2 models.

- Identify which of the 2 models we trust most, and  to determine which features are most impactful in influencing the prediction

-practise how to tune our model

we shall be using Decision trees and SVM in the project
